18. What is Ether (ETH), Ethereum's native token, and how is it used beyond just transaction fees?
19. How do Ethereum's gas fees work, and what causes them to spike during high network activity?
20. What is the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), and why is it key to building decentralized apps (dApps)?
21. How has Ethereum's scalability improved with upgrades like the Merge, and what challenges remain?

## Phase 4: Solana - High-Speed Blockchains and Innovation
22. What is Solana, and how does it position itself as a faster alternative to Ethereum?
23. What is proof-of-history (PoH) in Solana, and how does it combine with PoS to achieve high transaction speeds?
24. Why can Solana process thousands of transactions per second, and what trade-offs does this speed introduce?
25. What is SOL, Solana's native token, and how does staking it contribute to network security?
26. How does Solana's architecture differ from Ethereum's in terms of validators and decentralization?
27. What are some real-world applications built on Solana, like DeFi protocols or NFT marketplaces?
28. How has Solana handled network outages in the past, and what measures are in place to prevent them?

## Phase 5: Intermediate - Transactions, Security, and Trading
29. What is a crypto transaction, and how long does it typically take to confirm on Bitcoin vs. Ethereum vs. Solana?
30. Why is two-factor authentication (2FA) crucial for securing your crypto accounts, and what are better alternatives like hardware wallets?
31. What are common scams in crypto, like phishing or rug pulls, and how can you spot them early?
32. How do you read a crypto chart candlesticks, support/resistance and what indicators help predict trends?
33. What is dollar-cost averaging (DCA), and why is it a beginner-friendly strategy for buying Bitcoin or Ethereum?
34. How do market orders differ from limit orders on exchanges, and when should you use each?
35. What role do stablecoins like USDT play in trading across Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana ecosystems?

## Phase 6: DeFi, NFTs, and Ecosystem Applications
36. What is decentralized finance (DeFi), and how does it use Ethereum or Solana to offer lending without banks?
37. How do liquidity pools work in DeFi, and why might you provide liquidity for ETH-SOL pairs?
38. What are non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and how have they exploded in popularity on Ethereum and Solana?
39. Why do NFTs have utility beyond art, like in gaming or real-world asset tokenization on Solana?
40. What is yield farming, and how can it generate returns on idle crypto assets across these chains?
41. How do cross-chain bridges connect Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, and what risks do they carry?

## Phase 7: Advanced - Scaling, Regulation, and Future Trends
42. What are layer-2 solutions like Lightning Network for Bitcoin or rollups for Ethereum, and how do they solve scalability?
43. How does Solana's approach to sharding compare to Ethereum's roadmap for handling mass adoption?
44. What regulatory challenges face Bitcoin as a store of value, and how might global laws evolve by 2030?
45. Why is privacy a growing concern in crypto, and what tech like zero-knowledge proofs is Ethereum exploring?
46. How could quantum computing threaten Bitcoin's security, and what upgrades are being discussed?
47. What is the potential for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana in emerging markets, like remittances or Web3 adoption?
48. If crypto goes mainstream, how might interoperability between these blockchains reshape global finance?
