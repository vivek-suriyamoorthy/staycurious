# Metabolism & Fitness: Guided Learning Prompts

## Phase 1: Fundamentals of Energy & Hormones
1. What is cortisol, and how does it affect energy, stress, and fat loss?
2. What is glycogen, and how is it stored and used in the body?
3. How does insulin work? How is it linked to glycogen and fat storage?
4. What is glycemic index, and how does it impact energy and fat burn?
5. What is insulin resistance, and how do I know if I have it?
6. What happens during a glucose spike and crash, and why does it trigger hunger?
7. What is leptin, and how does it regulate satiety?
8. What is ATP, and how does the body generate energy from food?
9. What are ketones, and when does the body start producing them?

## Phase 2: Fat Burning & Fuel Hierarchy
10. What is lipolysis, and when does fat burning begin?
11. What are free fatty acids (FFA) and glycerol? How does the body use them?
12. What happens to unused FFAs or glycerol in the bloodstream?
13. In what order does the body use fuel? (Glycogen → FFA → Glycerol → Ketones?)
14. When I feel hungry post-workout, does that always mean glycogen is depleted?
15. Does glycogen get used locally by the muscle trained?
16. How is fat globally consumed, while glycogen is used locally?

## Phase 3: Training, Recovery & Fatigue
17. How much of a workout is needed to deplete glycogen significantly?
18. Why do I feel refreshed after workouts, even when fasted?
19. How can I tell the difference between normal fatigue and high cortisol burnout?
20. What happens when I train in a fasted state? Is it good for fat burn?
21. Is it okay to skip food after a workout if I'm not hungry?
22. What is a good protocol for post-training meals on a fat-loss day?

## Phase 4: Food Behavior & Cravings
23. Why do we crave something sweet after a meal?
24. What causes sugar crashes and false hunger cues?

## Phase 5: Nutrition Strategy & Micronutrients
25. What are the best sources of magnesium, zinc, and potassium?
26. Should I track micronutrients or just focus on macros?
27. How do I balance carbs during the day for performance vs fat burn?
28. What is the difference between complex vs simple carbs?
29. Do all macros convert into glucose, and which ones get stored as fat?
30. How long does it take for glucose to convert to glycogen or fat?

## Phase 6: Lifestyle, Metabolic Flexibility & Mind-Body Connection
31. Why do I feel so happy, clear-headed, and creative after fasted workouts?
32. What hormones are responsible for mood elevation during fasted training?
33. What is metabolic flexibility, and how can I improve it?
34. Can regular deep breathing or walks improve cortisol and fat burn?
35. What is the role of hydration and electrolytes in energy and metabolism?

## Phase 7: Deeper Exploration & Advanced Concepts
36. How do insulin injections work if a person is insulin-resistant?
37. What's the difference between Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes in terms of insulin?
38. What is the real impact of oxidized fats and reheated oils on metabolism?
39. Is it true that alcohol halts fat burning, and for how long?
40. What are the benefits of fermented rice (palaya satham) on gut and recovery?
41. How do cooked vs raw vegetables affect nutrient absorption?
